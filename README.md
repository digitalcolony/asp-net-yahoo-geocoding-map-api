# Access Yahoo! Mapping API with `ASP.NET`

_Deprecated: Yahoo! no longer supports this API._

It was 2005 when I coded an `ASP.NET` web page to talk to the Yahoo! Mapping API. I used the code to create a website for my community in Rancho San Pasqual, but like everything great Yahoo! has ever done, they ruined it. But for a brief moment, they had the best mapping on the Internet.
